The concept of AI-Blocs is to have a simple scene with draggable objects that have scripts attached to them. The model can be run directly on the editor or be exported to a standalone script that runs on Tensorflow.

Variables are parsed from python scripts and can be edited from the AI-Blocs properties panel.
